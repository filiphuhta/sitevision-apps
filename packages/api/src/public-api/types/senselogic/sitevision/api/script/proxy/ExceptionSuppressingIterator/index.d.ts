/**
 * Decorates an iterator with exception suppressing behaviour and returns {@link ExceptionSuppressingProxy}s in order to ensure that no
 *  invocation will throw an exception.
 *
 *  <p>
 *     This iterator is of type <code>ExceptionSuppressingProxy</code> that is an implementation of a <em>Dynamic proxy</em> so not all
 *     methods can be directly invoked on objects retrieved by the <code>next</code> method. See {@link ExceptionSuppressingCollection}
 *     for an example of how this iterator can be used easily from Velocity and how to invoke methods not declared in an interface.
 *     See {@link ExceptionSuppressingProxy} for more information about dynamic proxies.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *  <strong>Important note! </strong>This interface is intended to be used <em>only</em> in contexts where exceptions thrown during iteration will
 *  cause <em>serious</em> trouble if they arise and the context doesn't provide proper exception handling (e.g. when executing a Velocity template).
 *  Suppressing exceptions is generally a bad idea and using this iterator will affect performance.
 *  Hence, this interface should only be used where the upsides with suppressing exceptions far outweighs the downsides.
 *  This interface should be used only as a temporary patch/solution until the "real" problem causing the exception has been solved.
 *  </p>
 *
 *  <p>
 *     An instance of the Sitevision class implementing this interface can be obtained directly via
 *     {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.Utils#getExceptionSuppressingIterator(java.util.Iterator)}
 *     or indirectly via {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.Utils#getExceptionSuppressingCollection(java.util.Collection)}.
 *     You would typically use the latter if you should iterate a collection with the Velocity #foreach loop.
 *     See {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.Utils} for how to obtain an instance of the <code>Utils</code> interface.

   *     won't throw any exceptions, invoking a method on the returned object might throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>.
